## #2 &ndash; Functional Default Arguments

### Outline
Java lacks a built-in way to define default arguments for methods and constructors. Over the years, several approaches have been proposed, each with its pros and cons. The most widely-known one uses *method overloading*, though varargs, null values, the builder pattern and even maps have been used as well. Here we propose a new approach based on functional constructs.
